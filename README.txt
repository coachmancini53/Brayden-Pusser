<-------Overall------->

the purpose of this website is to promote Kasey Harrison's photography businsess

picked the color black with white text to give it a sleek modern look

the nav bar is a transluscent black so that you can see through it but still have it present so that you can view it at all times

used a large amount of slideshows as per request of the client and to show all the photos because it is a photography company

the slideshow is automatic to keep the costumer focused on important sales info instead while still bringing notice to the quality of her photos

under each page there are widgets that are links to the clients social media where she uploads all of her content

the pages on the nav bar are organized from left to right to display importance based on how likely people are to want that service

for example wedding is were the most business comes from then portraits then product photography

<-------Weddings, Portraits, and Products------->

on the pages that are promoting a service (wedding, portraits, and product) it has the price then under it in smaller font it has the selling points and reasons you would want to pay for that service

on these pages there is another gallery that pertains to that specific catagory

under the gallery there is a section that outlines the selling points of that catagory with the price under it

under that there is a link to the contact page to where you can get in touch with the photographer

<-------Contact------->

the contact page is setup as a form that is sent to the photographer for a easy way to organize incoming clients

once you fill out the form it is sent to the photographer via email

I opted out of designing my on php so I used someone else's code to setup the automatic email system

the email system doesn't work with a html live view but will if it is online

<-------Gallery------>

there is a gallery tab is present to bring you to a place were you can pick what type of photography you want to look at (wedding portraits and art photography)

this is here to build confidence in the customer to pay for her services as a photographer

the gallery tab is divided into 3 different sections: portrait photos, wedding photos, and photos that are meant to be seen as art

It is setup like the previous slide show but it is controlled manually
